# Project TODOs

## GPU Management
- [!!!] Lock GPU in gpu_session.py to prevent other processes from using it

## Agent Management
- [!!!] Need shared data path to populate agents (agent.py)
- [!!] Put new agents directly in available agents (master.py)
- [!] Shared data is needed (even an empty matrix) to let agents properly display status to master (main.py)

## Job Processing
- [!] Implement result handling in jobs.py (e.g., pass to JobPool or collect files)

## Code Organization
- [!] Review and potentially refactor agent availability checking in master.py
